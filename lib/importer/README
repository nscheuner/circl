Rewrite importer with the following features:

- One transaction for both confirmation and importation
- Use the transaction to match double in one import
- Allow merge with existing entries or imported entries during the first transaction
- Validates length of every fields before trying to import. Strip if needed
- Make it modular, like exporter so the same transaction can be used with different ressources
